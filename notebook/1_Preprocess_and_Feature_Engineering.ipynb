    "## drop fnlwgt\n",

    "## education_num — is it truly ordinal / proper label encoding?\n",
    "Let's look at the mapping:\n",
    "Preschool=1, 1st-4th=2, 5th-6th=3, 7th-8th=4, 9th=5, 10th=6,\n",
    "11th=7, 12th=8, HS-grad=9, Some-college=10, Assoc-voc=11,\n",
    "Assoc-acdm=12, Bachelors=13, Masters=14, Prof-school=15, Doctorate=16\n",
    "This is ordinal — it follows a logical progression of educational attainment. And the numeric spacing is roughly meaningful: each step represents \"more education.\" So treating it as a numeric feature is reasonable.\n",
    "However, it's not a perfect linear scale. Is the jump from HS-grad (9) to Some-college (10) the same as Masters (14) to Prof-school (15)? Probably not in terms of income impact. So it's a reasonable label encoding but with the caveat that the relationship with income may not be perfectly linear.\n",
    "For tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) this doesn't matter — they handle ordinal features natively. For linear models, we might want to consider binning or treating it as categorical.\n",
    "My recommendation: keep education_num as-is, drop education. It's good enough for most models and has the strongest correlation with income (0.335).\n",
    "\n",
    "## binary transformations\n",
    "marital_status → Married / Not-married: The >50K rate splits cleanly — Married-civ-spouse (45%) and Married-AF-spouse (44%) vs everything else (4-10%). The signal is really about being married vs not. Simplifying reduces dimensionality from 7 categories to 1 binary.\n",
    "native_country → US / Non-US: 90% of the data is US. With 41 categories, most have tiny sample sizes and unreliable >50K rates. Binary encoding captures the main signal without noise.\n",
    "income → binary 1/0: Necessary for modeling, straightforward.\n",
    "capital_gain → has_capital_gain: 92% zeros. The presence of capital gains is a strong wealth signal. We could also keep the original amount as a second feature (log-transformed) for those who have it.\n",
    "capital_loss → has_capital_loss: Same logic, 95% zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question for you on capital_gain/loss: should we keep only the binary flag, or also keep the original amount (maybe log-transformed) alongside it? The amount might carry additional signal — e.g., someone with 99,999 capital gain is very different from someone with 500."
